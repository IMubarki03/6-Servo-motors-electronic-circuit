## procedure
### Step1
An Arduino Uno R3 has been installed, a breadboard, number of 6 Servo motors, and number of 4 AA 1.5v batteries(sum of 6v) are also installed.
### Step2
The 6 Servo motors have been alligned to each other(side by side), as an important step for good and clear connection.
### Step3
The 4 AA 1.5v batteries positive pin has been connected to the breadboard positive line, as well as the negative pin has been connected to the breadboard negative line, as a step to nextly energies the 6 Servo motors from these two lines as follows:
  - connect each positive pin of a Servo motor to the positive line, respectively.
  - connect each negative pin of a Servo motor to the negative line, respectively.

### Step4
Connect each signal pin of a Servo motor to the Uno R3 PWM digital pins(3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11) respectively.

**Additionaly**, a number of 2 multimeter have been installed, for one to measure the voltage across Servo3; and another to measure the current flowing through Servo3, as an additive step to check out numbers.
