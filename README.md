Connect and program an electronic circuit consist of 6 Servo motors on TinkerCad

Parts required on TinkerCad are as follows

First of all, an Arduino Uno R3 has been installed, then a breadboard, then a number of 6 Servo motors are also installed.

Secondly, the 6 Servo motors have been alligned to each other(side by side), as an important step for good and clear connection.

Thirdly, the Uno R3 positive pin has been connected to the breadboard positive line, as well as the Uno R3 negative pin has been connected to the breadboard negative line, as a step to nextly energies the 6 Servo motors from these two lines as follows:
  - connect each positive pin of a Servo motor to the positive line, respectively.
  - connect each negative pin of a Servo motor to the negative line, respectively.

Forthly, connect each signal pin of a Servo motor to Uno R3 PWM digital pins(3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11) respectively.

Additionaly, a number of 2 multimeter have been installed, for one to measure the voltage across Servo3; and another to measure the current flowing through Servo3, as an additive step to check out numbers.
